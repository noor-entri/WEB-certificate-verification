# Entri App Certificate Verification
This workspace contains a web page used to verify certificates provided by Entri App, a learning platform. The app allows users to input certificate details and verify their authenticity. It ensures that the certificates issued by Entri App are valid and have not been tampered with. This verification process helps maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the certificates awarded to learners who have successfully completed courses on the platform.
